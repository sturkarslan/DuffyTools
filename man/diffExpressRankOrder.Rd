\title{
Order Differentially Expressed Genes
}
\description{
Orders the results of a differential expression calculation, as a 
combination of the reported fold change and P-value for each gene.
}
\usage{
diffExpressRankOrder(folds, pvalues, wt.folds=1, wt.pvalues=1,
		 two.sided.P.values=TRUE)

diffExpressDistanceRankOrder(folds, pvalues, dists, wt.folds=1, wt.pvalues=1,
		 wt.dists=1, two.sided.P.values=TRUE)
}
\arguments{
  \item{folds}{
numeric vector of fold change values.  Must be expresses as log2 
ratio values (no expression change equals 0)
}
  \item{pvalues}{
numeric vector of same length as \code{folds} giving the P-value 
associated with each fold change value
}
  \item{dists}{
numeric vector of same length as \code{folds} giving the distances
associated with each fold change value, where greater distance implies
greater difference in expression
}
  \item{wt.folds}{
scalar weight for the contribution of fold change rankings to the result
}
  \item{wt.pvalues}{
scalar weight for the contribution of P-value rankings to the result
}
  \item{wt.dists}{
scalar weight for the contribution of distance rankings to the result
}
  \item{two.sided.P.values}{
logical specifying whether the P-values came from a 2-sided or 1-sided 
test
}
}
\details{
Fold change is a way of describing the difference between two expression 
values as a ratio \code{ x1/x2 }.  For very low magnitudes, the fold 
change can be artifically high.  For very high magnitudes, the P-value can
be artifically small (especially in NextGen sequencing datasets).  This 
function calcualates the rank order by each criteria separately, and 
then uses a weighted average of those to produce the resulting gene rank order.
}
\value{
A vector of integer indices the same length as \code{folds}, giving the 
permutation order of the input from highest differentially expressed 
(most up-regulated) to lowest (most down-regulated).
}
\note{
In a usual 2-sided test, both the strongly up-regulated and strongly
down-regulated genes will have good P-values.  The function assumes this
about the given P-values.  If a 1-sided test that gives poor P-values for
the down-regulated genes was used, set \code{two.sided.P.value=FALSE}
